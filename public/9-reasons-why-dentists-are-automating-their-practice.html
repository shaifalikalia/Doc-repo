            "Dental practice automation has become a significant trend over the last couple of years and continues to
            climb at a rapid rate. Recent research predicts the market for healthcare chatbots alone to reach <a

              target="_blank">$703.2 million</a> by 2025, a 25.5% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) from 2019.
            Dentistry industry <a href="https://atlasresell.com/blogs/news/predicted-trends-in-dentistry-for-2022"
              target="_blank">trends</a> suggest that we can continue to expect the introduction of more
            novel and ground-breaking technology, which will immensely benefit both dentists and patients.</p>
          <p>
            But, why are dentists implementing digital automation platforms in their practice(s)? What are
            the benefits of doing so? Let’s dive into that...</p>
          <p>
            Digital transformation is changing how dental practices operate and how dental professionals
            interact with their patients, team, peers, and vendors. Notably, the ability to use artificial
            intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) to enhance decision making, reinvent business
            models and ecosystems, and remake the customer experience will <a
              href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/gartner-top-10-strategic-technology-trends-for-2018"
              target="_blank">drive the payoff</a> for digital
            initiatives through 2025.</p>
          <p>
            In response to rising patient expectations, escalating costs, and the need to do more in less
            time with fewer resources, AI-powered digital automation platforms will <a
              href="https://www.dataversity.net/the-digital-mesh-how-is-it-changing-enterprises/" target="_blank">become
              the norm</a> for
            many dental practices moving forward, automating interfaces between systems, processes, and
            users to enhance practice efficiency, boost profitability, and improve the patient experience.</p>
          <p>
            Digital automation platforms help dentistry professionals simplify and streamline their practice
            workflows to minimize paper-based administrative tasks, reduce operating costs, and improve
            communication and collaboration across the healthcare ecosystem. This includes but is not
            limited to:"</p>
        </div>

        <h2 class='sub-title super-sub-title'>Time savings</h2>
        <p class='description'>Adopting an automation platform enables you gain more personal time for family,
          friends,
          hobbies, and physical activity with efficient, integrated workflows. You can seamlessly and
          efficiently connect and collaborate with multiple stakeholders, including patients. Unnecessary
          and time-consuming administrative tasks in your practice are eliminated. Supplies from vendors
          to replenish stock are automatically ordered so you never run out or have excess that expires.
          Your billing and accounting is simplified through system integrations.
        </p>
        <h2 class='sub-title super-sub-title'>Reduced errors</h2>
        <p class='description'>Human error is inevitable, but it can be eliminated with the automation and integration
          of your
          entire healthcare ecosystem. Administrative mistakes and duplicated effort with efficient, reliable
          connectivity and communication are minimized.
        </p>

        <h2 class='sub-title super-sub-title'>Increased productivity</h2>
        <p class='description'>Operational roadblocks can happen when workflows are lacking optimization. With an
          automation platform, you can boost efficiency of business processes, such as staff scheduling,
          inventory management, and payroll. You can ensure healthcare personnel are in the right place
          at the right time with the resources they need to do their jobs and simplify their training across
          multiple clinics. Plus, patient interactions are streamlined for appointment scheduling and
          rescheduling, patient communication and follow-up.
        </p>
        <h2 class='sub-title super-sub-title'>Reduced costs</h2>
        <p class='description'>Costs can add up quickly in a practice. Leakage can happen in so many areas of the
          business.
          Creating automated processes can help reduce these leakages and reduce the headaches and
          frustration that come from them. With automation, you can improve inventory control and
          planning with automated ordering of supplies and tools to prevent overstock. Staff schedules
          are optimized and in alignment with patient bookings to maximize operational efficiency. Patient
          recalls and communication can be automated to minimize costly human errors and reduce
          personnel hours. You can leverage economies of scale by managing staff, patients, and
          operations at one or multiple clinics from a single cloud-based platform, as well as improve
          visibility to operational costs through dashboard and reports.
        </p>

        <h2 class='sub-title super-sub-title'>Practitioner work/life balance</h2>
        <p class='description'>Taking care of patients and managing personal time while maintaining a practice—with
          all the
          inefficient, manual administrative tasks and time-consuming behind-the-scenes work that is
          required to keep the office running smoothly—can take a toll. Dental professionals often find
          themselves stuck at the office, buried under paperwork and reports, or spinning their wheels
          trying to grow the business and sacrificing personal time with family and friends. With an
          automation platform, you minimize stress and friction with streamlined workflows and full
          integration across the healthcare ecosystem. You replace time-consuming admin tasks with
          personal time for self-care and connecting with family and friends.
        </p>

        <h2 class='sub-title super-sub-title'>Improved patient experience</h2>
        <p class='description'>Improvements in patient experience have been linked to benefits for both patients and
          practices.
          Patients have better outcomes and as a result practices improve patient retention and referrals.
          With an automation platform, patient experience and satisfaction are improved through a single
          place to view and manage patient-related information and book appointments, while enabling
          patients to search for, find and book appointments seamlessly through an online portal. It also
          supports automatic supply replenishments to ensure you have adequate inventory levels of
          supplies, tools, and resources on hand to provide high-quality care.
        </p>

        <h2 class='sub-title super-sub-title'>Tightened inventory control</h2>
        <p class='description'>As mentioned earlier, automation platforms support automatic supply replenishments to
          ensure
          you have adequate inventory levels of supplies, tools, and resources on hand. Inventory is
          tracked and monitored with automatic orders placed to vendors through platform integrations so
          stock levels are maintained and consistent, and you can avoid high costs associated with
          overstock and expired products.
        </p>

        <h2 class='sub-title super-sub-title'>Bettered hiring efficiency</h2>
        <p class='description'>Whether seeking dentists, dental hygienists, or administrative staff, the majority of
          dental
          practices, regardless of size, are finding the process of recruiting new employees “extremely
          challenging,” according to the <a
            href="https://www.ada.org/-/media/project/ada-organization/ada/ada-org/files/resources/research/hpi/july2022_hpi_economic_outlook_dentistry_report_main.pdf?rev=3dc9c6ea7fee40839b19a0ece7e812bb&hash=BA7EC999518A328DEB2BF49759A4FFA8"
            target="_blank">Economic Outlook and Emerging Issues in Dentistry</a> published in
          July 2022 by the ADA HPI. This makes it critical for the hiring experience to be seamless and
          positive for new staff. Automation platforms help you both onboard and offboard personnel with
          ease. When recruiting for new or vacant positions, they integrate with online job boards to post
          and share job opportunities at your practice as well as help qualified candidates find your vacant
          positions, quickly and easily. They also help you utilize internal personnel for temporary job
          placements and for backup when staff are on leave.
        </p>

        <h2 class='sub-title super-sub-title'>Positive employee experience</h2>
        <div class='description'>
          <p>Once your staff is hired and onboarded, that continued positive employee experience is enabled
            with an automation platform. Staff can view and manage work-related information from a single,
            fully-integrated platform creating optimized communication and collaboration across the entire
            healthcare ecosystem. Office workflows are streamlined to reduce stress and frustration,
            eliminating inefficient admin and data entry tasks to free up employees’ time. In the end,
            improved work/life balance is fostered for your staff.</p>
            <p>
              Adopting automation into your dental practice is critical towards getting out of the day-to-day
              operational trenches and into the sweet spot that has you doing more of what you love...helping
              patients! It helps to streamline office operations and in turn bolster efficiency, productivity,
              patient satisfaction and profits. From real-time online scheduling and digital patient forms to staff
              task assignment and management, automated reminders and patient recall, balancing out
              workflows has never been easier.</p>
