                            Today, successful dental practice owners are embracing a more holistic healthcare business
                            management strategy in order to manage rising costs, meet patient expectations, and do more
                            with less. They’re doing so by adopting the trend of implementing cloud-based, AI-driven,
                            fully-integrated digital automation platforms in order to automate interfaces between systems,
                            processes, and users. </p>
                        <p>
                            This integrated healthcare management approach helps dentists, office managers, healthcare
                            administrators, personnel, vendors, and patients connect, collaborate, and thrive by
                            simplifying
                            the everyday tasks of the business of healthcare management. </p>

                    <h2 class='sub-title'>Benefits of an Implementing a Fully-Integrated Digital Automation Platform
                    </h2>
                    <div class='description'>
                        <p>By automatically integrating a full range of healthcare management workflows—staff
                            management, payroll integration, patient scheduling, practice management, ordering,
                            inventory
                            management, patient communication—through an all-in-one platform, you can empower your
                            team, seamlessly communicate with your healthcare community, and simplify your day-to-day
                            operations to optimize patient care and grow your practice. You create a connected
                            healthcare
                            ecosystem that empowers participants. You have the ability to organize your business and
                            life
                            for increased efficiency, efficacy, and profits, whether you operate one practice or
                            multiple
                            clinics. And, you can simplify your practice to make your life easier and more
                            balanced—without
                            compromising patient care, business growth, or employee satisfaction.</p>
                        <p>
                            When streamlining and automating workflows across the practice, an integrated healthcare
                            business management platform delivers benefits for stakeholders within the organization
                            (e.g.,
                            dentists, hygienists, office staff), but also for individuals and entities interacting and
                            collaborating
                            with the practice, such as patients, pharmacists, specialists, and suppliers. </p>
                        <p>
                            Specifically, we have 9 benefits that an integrated solution offers to your dental practice:
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <h2 class='sub-title super-sub-title'>1. Saves time</h2>
                    <p class='description'>An integrated solution will support seamless and efficient connection and
                        collaboration with
                        multiple stakeholders, including patients. It eliminates unnecessary and time-consuming
                        administrative tasks, automatically orders supplies from vendors to replenish stock, simplifies
                        billing and accounting with integrated systems and allows you to
                        <a href='/top-9-ways-for-you-and-your-staff-to-avoid-burnout.html' target="_blank">gain more personal
                        time for
                        family, friends, hobbies, and physical activity</a> with efficient, integrated workflows.
                    </p>

                    <h2 class='sub-title super-sub-title'>2. Reduces practice errors</h2>
                    <p class='description'>Human error is impossible to avoid, but it’s possible to eliminate them with
                        automation and
                        integration of your entire healthcare ecosystem. With an integrated solution, you minimize
                        administrative mistakes and duplicated effort with efficient, reliable connectivity and
                        communication.
                    </p>
                    <h2 class='sub-title super-sub-title'>3. Increases practice productivity</h2>
                    <p class='description'>Practice productivity is critical to eliminating operational roadblocks.
                        There are several ways an
                        integrated solution can increase practice productivity. Staff scheduling, inventory management
                        and payroll process efficiencies are dramatically enhanced. Patient interactions such as
                        appointment scheduling, rescheduling, communication and follow-up become streamlined and
                        improve patient experience. For dentists operating multiple clinics, it simplifies and creates
                        consistency in staff training regardless of location and ensures that healthcare personnel are
                        in
                        the right place at the right time with the resources they need to do their jobs.
                    </p>

                    <h2 class='sub-title super-sub-title'>4. Reduces practice costs</h2>
                    <p class='description'>To maintain your practice success, you must be able to control your overhead
                        and cut costs.
                        Overhead is like cancer: it merely wants to grow and spread. By leveraging an integrated
                        solution, dental practices are experiencing tremendous benefits through improved visibility to
                        operational costs through dashboard and reports. Your inventory control and planning process
                        become streamlined with automated ordering of supplies and tools to prevent overstock. Staff
                        schedules are optimized in alignment with patient bookings to maximize operational efficiency.
                        Patient recalls and communication are automated to minimize costly human errors and reduce
                        personnel hours. And finally, you can leverage economies of scale by managing staff, patients,
                        and operations at one or multiple clinics from a single cloud-based platform.
                    </p>

                    <h2 class='sub-title super-sub-title'>5. Improve work/life balance</h2>
                    <p class='description'>Taking care of patients and managing personal time while maintaining a
                        practice—with all the
                        inefficient, manual administrative tasks and time-consuming behind-the-scenes work that is
                        required to keep the office running smoothly—can take a toll. Dental professionals often find
                        themselves stuck at the office, buried under paperwork and reports, or spinning their wheels
                        trying to grow the business and sacrificing personal time with family and friends. With a
                        digital
                        automation platform, you will minimize stress and friction with streamlined workflows and full
                        integration across the healthcare ecosystem and you can replace time-consuming admin tasks
                        with personal time for self-care and connecting with family and friends.
                    </p>

                    <h2 class='sub-title super-sub-title'>6. Deliver superior patient experience</h2>
                    <p class='description'>A positive patient experience is essential to the success of any business,
                        but especially in
                        healthcare settings. Of course patients want the best possible care, but they also want to feel
                        seen, heard and understood. With an integrated platform, you have one place to view and
                        manage health-related information and book appointments. Patients have access to an online
                        portal to find and book an appointment quickly and seamlessly at a time that is convenient for
                        them without having to call your office. You can create a streamlined billing experience and
                        also
                        automatically ensure that you have adequate inventory levels of supplies, tools, and resources
                        on hand to provide high-quality care.
                    </p>

                    <h2 class='sub-title super-sub-title'>7. Improve hiring efficiency</h2>
                    <p class='description'>Hiring and retaining dental assistants has become the <a

                        dentists. And now that dental practices have reopened post COVID-19, pent up consumer
                        demand is expected to drive a <a

                            target="_blank">20%</a> year-over-year growth going forward. Unfortunately,
                        dentists’ offices are running with less clinical and support staff and experiencing high
                        turnover
                        rates. With an integrated solution, you can onboard and offboard personnel with ease. Your
                        available job placements, permanent or temporary, are integrated with online job boards
                        enabling you to post and share job opportunities at your practice helping qualified candidates
                        find your vacant positions, quickly and easily. Plus, you can utilize internal personnel for
                        temporary job placements and for backup when staff are on leave.
                    </p>

                    <h2 class='sub-title super-sub-title'>8. Tighten inventory control</h2>
                    <p class='description'>By automating inventory management tasks, you can take the guesswork out of
                        ordering
                        supplies; you will never run out of the materials and tools you need to run your practice and
                        never have to worry about over-ordering or expired products. An integrated healthcare business
                        management platform can conduct automated stock audits to determine what supplies you have
                        on hand and how much you’ve used. It helps you avoid overstock and expired products and
                        when stock is running low, supplies can be automatically ordered from preferred vendors to
                        replenish stock.
                    </p>
                    <h2 class='sub-title super-sub-title'>9. Create positive employee experience</h2>
                    <p class='description'>Dentists are looking for something that can make their practice stand out
                        from the competition

                        assistants

                            target="_blank">number one challenge</a> they currently face as mentioned above. With a
                        single, fully
                        integrated platform, you can foster improved work/life balance and enable staff to view and
                        manage work-related information from one application. Communication and collaboration across
                        the healthcare ecosystem is optimized with streamlined office workflows, which reduce stress
                        and frustration, and inefficient admin and data entry tasks to free up employees’ time.
