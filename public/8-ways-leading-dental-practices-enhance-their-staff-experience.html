                    <p> Managing a dental practice comes with a lot of responsibilities. As the leader of your practice,
                        patient care is undoubtedly your top priority. However, both financial success for your practice
                        and professional success for you and your employees are equally important. A positive
                        employee experience through a healthy and thriving work environment will ultimately help you
                        deliver on this financial success and better patient experience. </p>
                    <p>
                        Taking on all of this responsibility can be overwhelming, so we’ve compiled 6 ways to enhance
                        your staff experience to create job satisfaction, improve employee retention and morale and
                        ultimately deliver an impactful patient experience which translates into repeat visits, patient
                        referrals and revenue.</p>
                </div>


                <h2 class='sub-title super-sub-title'>1. Build Relationships with Your Team</h2>
                <div class='description'>
                    <p>A healthy workplace culture takes its cues from strong leadership. You can’t lead unless your
                        team respects you and you can’t build respect unless they know you. So the first step to
                        creating a positive employee experience and culture in your practice is to build relationships
                        with your team.</p>
                    <p>
                        Relationships take time and effort. You can’t be the aloof boss who eats lunch alone in his/her
                        office. You have to be willing to eat together, have conversations about work and non-work
                        topics, share experiences, and genuinely care about your team members’ lives.</p>
                    <p>
                        Building relationships does not mean being best friends with everyone on your team. You can
                        be friendly, but it’s important to still maintain some professional distance and boundaries
                        because at some point you may have to make hard decisions regarding their employment. You
                        don’t want friendships getting in the way of your ability to make good decisions for your
                        business.</p>
                </div>
                <h2 class='sub-title super-sub-title'>2. Initiate Clear Lines of Communication</h2>
                <div class='description'>
                    <p>Communication breakdown is one of the key challenges of busy dental offices. When
                        communication isn't fluid between staff members, every aspect of your practice can begin to
                        suffer. You'll need to go the extra mile to make sure that the lines of communication remain
                        open and that all of your employees feel heard and fully understand their responsibilities and
                        your expectations.</p>
                    <p>
                        One way to help you communicate clearly to your staff and pursue a positive work environment
                        is to put everything in writing. This includes any procedural or schedule changes, as well as
                        anything else that will impact your office staff. Putting your plans in writing may help prevent
                        misunderstandings via verbal communication.</p>
                    <p>
                        The perfect way to accomplish this is through an integrated healthcare management platform.
                        Leading platforms support simple, seamless and effective internal communication. For example,
                        you can communicate with your team with advanced task management and notes functions
                        offering two way communication so they know exactly what their responsibilities are for every
                        shift and mark tasks as completed with notes back to you so you know what has been
                        accomplished.</p>
                    <p>
                        You can also have a short meeting every morning to set expectations for the day where you
                        allow employees to make you aware of any issues that may impact the day, or host a working
                        lunch once every week or two where you can meet with your staff and take a deeper dive into
                        solid communication.</p>
                    <p>
                        Finally, use communication to keep the dental office light and positive. Don’t be afraid to use
                        humor, just keep it appropriate for the workplace. Praise your team when they perform well.
                        When there is a problem, use solution-focused language to move forward and avoid blaming
                        people and exacerbating the conflict.</p>
                </div>

                <h2 class='sub-title super-sub-title'>3. Recognize Your Employees</h2>
                <div class='description'>
                    <p>Employee recognition is huge in any workplace, but it's especially important for working
                        environments that are innately stressful to a certain degree. The dental industry certainly fits
                        the
                        bill, so make sure to keep employee recognition high on your priority list.</p>
                    <p>
                        Be sure to applaud employees who routinely go above and beyond the call of duty at your
                        practice. This “going above and beyond” could include helping a coworker, reworking an
                        established process so it’s more efficient, maintaining a positive attitude, taking on
                        additional
                        responsibilities and more. </p>
                    <p>
                        Remember the adage, “an employee (or person) who feels appreciated will always do more
                        than expected.” This phrase is more than mere words, it’s actually been proven scientifically
                        accurate. </p>
                    <p>
                        When your employees go out of their way to help a patient, resolve a conflict with another
                        employee in a positive manner, or engage in any behavior that helps foster a positive culture,
                        recognize them. Make sure these actions are stored and reflected in your staff's employment
                        record within your integrated healthcare management platform for future reference during
                        performance reviews and potential pay raises providing the well deserved recognition. You can
                        also send a thank you email or a place Post-It note for them in their work area for quick, daily
                        kudos. In cases where employees deserve more recognition, consider a small gift at the end of
                        the month given during staff meetings to recognize and reward staff members who have gone
                        out of their way to create positivity.</p>
                </div>

                <h2 class='sub-title super-sub-title'>4. Cross Train Your Staff</h2>
                <div class='description'>
                    <p>It's inevitable that administrative staff, hygienists or dental assistants will need to take time
                        off
                        and sometimes unexpectedly in the case of illness or emergency. If your current staff isn't
                        cross
                        trained to do different jobs, your practice (and your patients) can feel the sting of the
                        missing
                        employee.</p>
                    <p>
                        Ensure your staff is cross trained to perform different jobs in a pinch, but avoid
                        cross-training a
                        single employee to know how to do more than one other job (or two if the jobs are closely
                        related). Employees should feel capable of doing the second job when needed but not
                        overwhelmed by too many responsibilities. It’s understandable some job roles require
                        certificates and formalized training such as dental assistants; however training staff to help
                        with
                        administrative tasks like reception in event your receptionist is ill is crucial to a smooth
                        running
                        practice that consistently delivers on a positive patient experience.</p>
                    <p>
                        If giving employees additional responsibilities through cross training, also be sure that you
                        provide the corresponding pay. Ensuring they are paid appropriately for all they do or even
                        generously will show them they are valued for their work and the time invested in the practice.
                        Doing so will ensure that they feel immensely valuable to your practice.</p>
                </div>

                <h2 class='sub-title super-sub-title'>5. Hire Like-Minded People</h2>
                <div class='description'>
                    <p>Team members who get along and like working together will naturally foster a positive culture in
                        your dental office. If you hire someone who is too different from the group, there’s a good
                        chance you’ll create fractures that erode the office vibe.</p>
                    <p>
                        Whenever you hire someone, ask yourself how well they will fit in with the group. If you can,
                        invite a potential hire to work a few days with your team before you make your final decision
                        (paid time of course!). Ask your team for input on whether potential new hire will fit in with
                        the
                        group.</p>
                    <p>
                        If you have an employee who doesn’t seem to get along with the group, it’s critical that you
                        remove them from the workplace. A disruptive employee who always seems to be at the center
                        of tension – whether through their own actions or simple incompatibility – will poison your
                        office
                        and ultimately give good employees a reason to leave.</p>
                </div>

                <h2 class='sub-title super-sub-title'>6. Lead by Example</h2>
                <div class='description'>
                    <p>Leadership isn’t simple and leading well can be a challenge. However, if you want to create a
                        positive work environment for your practice, you have to lead the way as the practice owner.
                        It starts with you! If you want your team to behave in a certain way, you have to exhibit that
                        behavior at all times. Your team will look to you as an example. No mission statement, value
                        list,
                        or standard operating procedure is as effective as your behavior.</p>
                    <p>
                        If you want your staff to have fun, you have to demonstrate the type of fun culture you want to
                        instill in your practice. If you tell your team that communication is important, but then fail
                        to
                        communicate with them at critical times, they won’t take communication seriously. They’ll
                        question how important communication really is to you if you’re not communicating effectively
                        with them. If you expect everyone to be a team player, even if a task doesn’t fall within the
                        bounds of their job description, it’s important to model that. You aren’t too good to answer the
                        phone or take out the trash.</p>
                    <p>
                        It’s also important to have an open-door policy so your staff feels they can come to you with
                        any
                        questions or concerns without fear of your reaction. </p>
                </div>

                <h2 class='sub-title super-sub-title'>7. Don’t Forget to Have Fun</h2>
                <div class='description'>
                    <p>Last but certainly not least, have fun! A dental practice or any place of business for that
                        matter
                        shouldn’t feel like a prison or invoke feelings of dread. Don’t worry though, you can still have
                        an
                        environment that is both professional and fun at the same time. </p>
                    <p>
                        Try implementing some of these ideas into your practice to create a fun, light-hearted workplace
                        that evokes positive feelings:</p>
                    <p>
                    <ul>
                        <li> Start a casual Friday or “print day” for staff who wear scrubs, allowing employees to
                            choose a printed scrub or their scrub pants</li>
                        <li>Let your staff decorate for the holidays or play music</li>
                        <li> Create fun work-place challenges</li>
                        <li> Keep your break room stocked with goodies and more</li>
                        <li> Hold workplace wellness workshops or host wellness challenges</li>
                    </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The overall goal is to just make your office fun and a place that your team looks forward to
                        coming to every day. </p>

                </div>
                <h2 class='sub-title super-sub-title'>8. Support Work-Life Balance For Your Team</h2>
                <p class='description'>Your dental practice may be the most important thing in your life, but your team
                    members have
                    lives outside of your office. Don’t expect them to show the same level of dedication as you.
                    Show your team you value them by giving them the time they need outside of work to enjoy their
                    lives. Don’t force them to miss important events like graduations, weddings, or birthdays.
                    Encourage them to use their paid time for leisure and travel. Insist they stay home when they’re
                    sick, which is equally important for your patients health as well.
                </p>
                <h2 class='sub-title'>Creating a Positive Culture and Experience</h2>
                <div class='description'>
                    <p>Creating a positive dental office culture isn’t a one and done thing. Fostering a healthy culture
                        to
                        drive a positive employee experience is a daily responsibility, even if the culture already
                        feels
                        positive. You need to take action to maintain an already positive culture to avoid any issues
                        from coming up. </p>
                    <p>
                        Enact the tips listed above to pursue a positive work environment and experience for your staff
                        and your patients. Don’t worry about your office suddenly becoming unprofessional simply
                        because you are inserting a little light-heartedness into the office setting. Having fun doesn't
                        mean being unprofessional. It simply means you’re creating a more positive work environment
                        for all involved. </p>
                        <p>
                            If you aren’t happy with your office culture, you know that creating a positive one takes effort
                            and time. It’s important to start right away. If you aren’t taking your office’s culture
                            seriously,
                            there could be unseen issues that eat away at everyone’s job satisfaction. </p>
