                       <p>
                            Successful communication is a key component for a thriving dental practice. Effective internal,
                            interoffice communication is essential for ensuring efficiency in your day-to-day operations. It
                            allows for everyone—from the doctor, hygienists, office managers, practice administrators and
                            assistants—to have a sense of what’s happening in the practice any time throughout the day.
                            Staff knows exactly what needs to be done based on their specific role in the practice and can
                            seamlessly operate in their function with ease.</p>
                       <p>
                            One way to achieve a hands-on approach with effective practice communication, while being
                            completely hands off, is to implement an integrated healthcare management solution. With the
                            digital automation these tools provide, communication with your team is simple, seamless and
                            reliable. </p>
                       <p>
                            One key way these platforms accommodate this is through effective task management,
                            assignment and notes to the team. Task management and notes automatically let you and your
                            staff know what’s happening in the practice and what their responsibilities are.</p>
                       <p>
                            Team members are juggling multiple tasks in their workday. These manual tasks that team
                            members participate in for a patient’s dental visit are typically characterized by data entry,
                            followed by decision-making. With an automated solution, data entry is minimized and errors
                            reduced in the practice with pre-built workflows. In return, your team saves time, no longer
                            experiences unnecessary friction, and quality of patient care is improved as a result.</p>
                       <p>
                            Practice owners can manage all assigned tasks across the organization, tracking variables such
                            as task status, due dates, and reminders. Notes with additional details can also be included for
                            greater detail and context. This holistic approach to task management ensures everyone in the
                            practice knows what they’re required to do for the day and results are easily communicated and
                            shared between parties. </p>
                       <p>
                            For example, tasks can be assigned to:</p>
                       <p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Receptionists to follow-up with a patient or call the insurance company</li>
                                <li>Office personnel to contact the IT team for technology support or resolve a facility issue</li>
                                <li>Dental assistants to confirm adequate supply of materials and tools for the upcoming
                                    month</li>
                                <li>Hygienists or dental assistants to conduct an oral health assessment on a new patient,
                                    prepare and take x-rays, or perform dental cleaning</li></ul></p>
                       <p>
                            Important tasks no longer get missed or forgotten and your team feels empowered to hit the
                            ground running the moment they clock in.</p>
                       <p>
                            There are other ways that an integrated healthcare management solution supports effective
                            communication in your practice. </p>
                       <p>
                            Like practice owners and managers, dentists can communicate with personnel on different
                            types of workflows, as well as easily assign and manage daily tasks for personnel across
                            various job roles within the practice. They can also connect with and streamline their
                            communication with other dentists or specialists for peer review processes, patient referrals,
                            and other practice matters.</p>
                       <p>
                            Hygienists, dental assistants, office and admin staff can communicate with dentists and
                            managers efficiently and reliably in return. They can access online HR forms and documents,
                            such as contracts and proof of employment forms, eliminating the need to make a direct request
                            for copies or get access to them. And all personnel across the organization can be viewed on
                            one scheduler to create an event and invite employees; and view and apply for job postings.
                            Plus, they can easily request leave or request to work on different dates/times in different offices
                            (in a multi-office organization). </p>
                       <p>
                            This staff scheduling is a huge component of effective practice communications, but can be
                            complex and time consuming. It doesn’t have to be complicated however. You can create and
                            communicate schedules in just minutes and manage time off, availability and shift requests,
                            track employee hours, and overtime scheduling with ease. In return, you will reduce
                            absenteeism and late arrivals, and handle unexpected changes without adding unnecessary
                            stress and frustration to your day.</p>
                       <p>
                            You can also streamline internal communication and create a collaborative environment no
                            matter where your staff or colleagues are by sending messages in group or private
                            conversations. This keeps everyone informed, gives employees a voice, and in return, builds a
                            better company culture that fosters employee satisfaction and retention.</p>
                            <p>
                              Dental practices face the challenge of communicating efficiently between all levels of the
                              organization: dentists, dental associates, pharmacists, peers (e.g., specialists), patients,
                              administrative staff, and suppliers of goods and services.  Without a streamlined, secure, and
                              centralized communication system practices struggle to ensure dentists and staff have the
                              resources they need to deliver high-quality patient care and manage the business requirements
                              of the practice. With an integrated healthcare management solution, this is easily achieved.</p>
