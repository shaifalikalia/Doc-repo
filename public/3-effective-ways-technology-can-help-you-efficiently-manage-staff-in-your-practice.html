                        <p>   Dentistry is constantly evolving with new technology and advancement in practice operations
                            and treatment protocols to improve both staff and patient satisfaction. Aside from improving
                            clinical and administrative aspects in dentistry, dentists still find the profession challenging and
                            even stressful at times. Dental practice ownership is not a course taught in dental school or
                            residency; it takes time and experience to understand all of the responsibilities associated with
                            practice ownership. </p>
                        <p>
                            Many dentists are unprepared for the challenges associated with being a solo practice owner,
                            particularly as it relates to personnel related administrative duties, such as human resources,
                            payroll, timesheets and managing and scheduling your team. With the right approach, you can
                            eliminate this stress, schedule quickly and easily, improve staff satisfaction, and find more
                            personal time for work/life balance. </p>
                        <p>
                            One key way to achieve this harmony in your daily practice life is through your integrated
                            healthcare management solution. Here are three ways how:</p></div>

                    <h2 class='sub-title super-sub-title'>1. HR Management:</h2>
                    <div class='description'>  <p>One pervasive issue impacting the management of the human resource (HR) function within a
                        dental practice is that despite years of medical education, dentists often are not educated in
                        management and strategic planning. This is a critical deficit as this function is inexorably tied to
                        the overall strategic goals of the practice. Many dentists combine the functions of the office
                        manager with that of an HR manager, or personally perform these duties themselves. This
                        double duty can create a lot of additional stress and work in an already hectic day.</p>
                        <p>
                            An integrated healthcare management platform eases this burden by providing a single location
                            where all your staff profiles can be stored, monitored and managed in one place. This includes
                            access to online HR forms and documents, such as contracts, proof of employment and
                            performance reviews. It also enables you to view all personnel across your organization on one
                            scheduler. For example, this single view allows you to create an event, like an annual holiday
                            party, and invite employees to it right through the application and automatically notify your team
                            of the upcoming event particulars. </p>
                        <p>
                            Another key function supporting your practice is the ability to list job postings for your open full
                            time or temporary positions, which is critical with the <Link to="6-ways-to-recruit-and-retain-practice-employees-in-2023" target="_blank">current recruitment challenges</Link> facing the
                            dentistry industry. You can advertise them to your existing team members or automatically post
                            them on integrated job boards to help qualified candidates find your vacant positions, quickly
                            and easily to expedite your hiring process. Once your new staff is hired, you can also streamline
                            your hiring process by creating automated onboarding workflows (and off boarding should the
                            time come) so training is consistent for everyone in your practice(s).</p>
                    </div>
                    <h2 class='sub-title super-sub-title'>2. Staff Scheduling and Time Management</h2>
                    <div class='description'>  <p>Your dental office is a busy place, with patients constantly coming and going and receiving the
                        various professional treatments you provide. But you see what patients don’t see – that the
                        constant fluctuation of your staff is also a busy and sometimes complicated conundrum of
                        scheduling and staffing requirements. Scheduling and time management headaches are
                        common issues in a dental practice.</p>
                        <p>
                            What happens behind the scenes must function smoothly to facilitate the careful consideration
                            and treatment of patients because let’s face it, no dental practice owner wants to be scrambling
                            to cover shifts. This includes managing vacations, ensuring coverage for sick days, hiring temps
                            and multi-location scheduling complexities for businesses with more than one practice. </p>
                        <p>
                            With an integrated healthcare management solution, scheduling and time management
                            becomes streamlined and efficient. Your staff can easily book/request time off and quickly share
                            them in your office calendar. As a practice owner, you can quickly align your staff availability
                            and schedules with patient bookings to maximize operational efficiency and maintain a healthy
                            level of profitability. </p>
                        <p>
                            When it comes time for a shift, your staff can automatically clock-in and click-out using their
                            mobile phone or a dedicated workstation in your office, making timesheet tracking and payroll
                            processes as headache free as possible, which leads to our third way to more effectively
                            manage your staff...</p>
                    </div>

                    <h2 class='sub-title super-sub-title'>3. Timesheets and Payroll</h2>
                    <div class='description'>  <p>Handling payroll is one of the most arduous tasks a dentist/owner has to deal with on a regular
                        basis. A dentist with 6-10 employees can spend anywhere between two to four hours a week
                        focusing on payroll. Doing it yourself eats up valuable time that would be better spent treating
                        patients or <a href="/top-9-ways-for-you-and-your-staff-to-avoid-burnout.html" target="_blank">creating a sense of work/life balance</a> where you can focus on self-care and time with
                        your loved ones. </p>
                        <p>
                            When using an advanced integrated healthcare management solution in your practice(s), you
                            can gain clarity, save time and take control of your personnel’s working hours. These non-
                            clinical operations are automated to create efficiency with frictionless workflows for timesheets
                            and payroll. </p>
                        <p>
                            Through the platform, you can view your staff cost in real-time to identify trends and improve
                            staff utilization when it comes to patient care and providing the best possible experience. Your
                            staff timesheets are also digitized allowing your staff to clock-in and out with efficiency for every
                            shift. They can easily submit their timesheets or create an invoice for the next pay period for
                            review and approval. Office managers and practice owners can then view timesheets in real-
                            time on a mobile phone, approve them and generate reports to streamline the payroll process.</p>
                            <p>
                                These are just three ways that an integrated healthcare management platform can improve your
                                practice’s operational efficiencies.</p><p> For more tips on managing your practice effectively, download our <span id="guide" class="link-btn">Ultimate Guide to Creating Order from Chaos in Your Dental Practice.</span></a> </p>
