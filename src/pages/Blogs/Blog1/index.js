                Digital automation platforms help dentistry professionals
                simplify and streamline their practice workflows to minimize
                paper-based administrative tasks, reduce operating costs, and
                improve communication and collaboration across the healthcare
                ecosystem. This includes but is not limited to:"

              Adopting an automation platform enables you gain more personal
              time for family, friends, hobbies, and physical activity with
              efficient, integrated workflows. You can seamlessly and
              efficiently connect and collaborate with multiple stakeholders,
              including patients. Unnecessary and time-consuming administrative
              tasks in your practice are eliminated. Supplies from vendors to
              replenish stock are automatically ordered so you never run out or
              have excess that expires. Your billing and accounting is
              simplified through system integrations.

              Operational roadblocks can happen when workflows are lacking

              efficiency of business processes, such as staff scheduling,
              inventory management, and payroll. You can ensure healthcare
              personnel are in the right place at the right time with the
              resources they need to do their jobs and simplify their training
              across multiple clinics. Plus, patient interactions are
              streamlined for appointment scheduling and rescheduling, patient
              communication and follow-up.

              Costs can add up quickly in a practice. Leakage can happen in so

              reduce these leakages and reduce the headaches and frustration
              that come from them. With automation, you can improve inventory
              control and planning with automated ordering of supplies and tools
              to prevent overstock. Staff schedules are optimized and in
              alignment with patient bookings to maximize operational
              efficiency. Patient recalls and communication can be automated to
              minimize costly human errors and reduce personnel hours. You can
              leverage economies of scale by managing staff, patients, and
              operations at one or multiple clinics from a single cloud-based
              platform, as well as improve visibility to operational costs
              through dashboard and reports.

              administrative tasks and time-consuming behind-the-scenes work
              that is required to keep the office running smoothly—can take a
              toll. Dental professionals often find themselves stuck at the
              office, buried under paperwork and reports, or spinning their
              wheels trying to grow the business and sacrificing personal time
              with family and friends. With an automation platform, you minimize
              stress and friction with streamlined workflows and full
              integration across the healthcare ecosystem. You replace
              time-consuming admin tasks with personal time for self-care and

              With an automation platform, patient experience and satisfaction
              are improved through a single place to view and manage
              patient-related information and book appointments, while enabling
              patients to search for, find and book appointments seamlessly
              through an online portal. It also supports automatic supply

              and monitored with automatic orders placed to vendors through
              platform integrations so stock levels are maintained and
