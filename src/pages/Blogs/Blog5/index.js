                Dentistry is constantly evolving with new technology and
                advancement in practice operations and treatment protocols to
                improve both staff and patient satisfaction. Aside from
                improving clinical and administrative aspects in dentistry,
                dentists still find the profession challenging and even
                stressful at times. Dental practice ownership is not a course
                taught in dental school or residency; it takes time and
                experience to understand all of the responsibilities associated
                with practice ownership.{" "}
              </p>
              <p>
                Many dentists are unprepared for the challenges associated with
                being a solo practice owner, particularly as it relates to
                personnel related administrative duties, such as human
                resources, payroll, timesheets and managing and scheduling your
                team. With the right approach, you can eliminate this stress,
                schedule quickly and easily, improve staff satisfaction, and
                find more personal time for work/life balance.{" "}
              </p>
              <p>
                One key way to achieve this harmony in your daily practice life
                is through your integrated healthcare management solution. Here
                are three ways how:

            <div className="description">
              {" "}
              <p>
                One pervasive issue impacting the management of the human
                resource (HR) function within a dental practice is that despite
                years of medical education, dentists often are not educated in
                management and strategic planning. This is a critical deficit as
                this function is inexorably tied to the overall strategic goals
                of the practice. Many dentists combine the functions of the
                office manager with that of an HR manager, or personally perform
                these duties themselves. This double duty can create a lot of
                additional stress and work in an already hectic day.
              </p>
              <p>
                An integrated healthcare management platform eases this burden
                by providing a single location where all your staff profiles can
                be stored, monitored and managed in one place. This includes
                access to online HR forms and documents, such as contracts,
                proof of employment and performance reviews. It also enables you
                to view all personnel across your organization on one scheduler.
                For example, this single view allows you to create an event,
                like an annual holiday party, and invite employees to it right
                through the application and automatically notify your team of
                the upcoming event particulars.{" "}
              </p>
              <p>
                Another key function supporting your practice is the ability to
                list job postings for your open full time or temporary
                positions, which is critical with the{" "}

                facing the dentistry industry. You can advertise them to your
                existing team members or automatically post them on integrated
                job boards to help qualified candidates find your vacant
                positions, quickly and easily to expedite your hiring process.
                Once your new staff is hired, you can also streamline your
                hiring process by creating automated onboarding workflows (and
                off boarding should the time come) so training is consistent for
                everyone in your practice(s).

                Your dental office is a busy place, with patients constantly
                coming and going and receiving the various professional
                treatments you provide. But you see what patients don’t see –
                that the constant fluctuation of your staff is also a busy and
                sometimes complicated conundrum of scheduling and staffing
                requirements. Scheduling and time management headaches are
                common issues in a dental practice.

                What happens behind the scenes must function smoothly to
                facilitate the careful consideration and treatment of patients
                because let’s face it, no dental practice owner wants to be
                scrambling to cover shifts. This includes managing vacations,
                ensuring coverage for sick days, hiring temps and multi-location
                scheduling complexities for businesses with more than one

                With an integrated healthcare management solution, scheduling
                and time management becomes streamlined and efficient. Your
                staff can easily book/request time off and quickly share them in
                your office calendar. As a practice owner, you can quickly align
                your staff availability and schedules with patient bookings to
                maximize operational efficiency and maintain a healthy level of

                Handling payroll is one of the most arduous tasks a
                dentist/owner has to deal with on a regular basis. A dentist
                with 6-10 employees can spend anywhere between two to four hours
                a week focusing on payroll. Doing it yourself eats up valuable

                staff timesheets are also digitized allowing your staff to
                clock-in and out with efficiency for every shift. They can
                easily submit their timesheets or create an invoice for the next
                pay period for review and approval. Office managers and practice
                owners can then view timesheets in real- time on a mobile phone,
