                More than ever before, we’re hearing from dentistry
                professionals these words: I’m burned out.{" "}

                Taking care of patients and managing personal time while
                maintaining a practice—with all the inefficient, manual
                administrative tasks and time-consuming behind-the-scenes work
                that is required to keep the office running smoothly—can take a
                toll. Dental professionals often find themselves stuck at the
                office, buried under paperwork and reports, or spinning their
                wheels trying to grow the business and sacrificing personal time
                with family and friends. The ADA’s 2021 Dentist Health and

                2003—and 13% had experienced depression.{" "}
              </p>
              <p>
                Practice owners need to ask themselves: “Do I have enough time
                for self-care? Am I able to spend time with family and friends?
                Do I have the time and energy to exercise, participate in my
                interests, hobbies, and all the other activities that keep me
                healthy in body and mind?” Many will undoubtedly say no.{" "}
              </p>
              <p>
                However, self-care and a healthy work/life balance are vital for
                a practitioner’s mental health, their team’s well being and the
                ability to deliver optimal care to patients. Fostering mental
                resilience and a positive culture are critical components of any
                operation; without the systems in place to support
                communication, reduce friction, and simplify tasks and
                processes, practice owners risk compromising their staff’s
                work/life balance and job satisfaction, and end up creating an
                environment that leads to burnout—for both themselves and their
                staff.{" "}

            <h2 className="sub-title super-sub-title">1. Exercise Regularly</h2>
            <p className="description">
              Exercise generally offers a wealth of incredibly positive results.

              by boosting your feel good endorphins. Exercise releases
              endorphins that help balance mood and foster a sense of well-
              being, among other positive results. It also improves your
              physical health and well being from improved cardiovascular
              function right through to establishing good sleep habits. As a
              result, exercise can also help improve morale and boost self
              confidence, which is a helpful cure to the cynicism and negativity
              that burnout can create.

            <h2 className="sub-title super-sub-title">2. Get Enough Sleep</h2>
            <p className="description">
              Getting a good night's sleep can play a crucial role in anyone’s
              mood and health, which can effectively support you when dealing
              with stress. Exercise as mentioned above can be one way to help
              yourself get enough sleep. You can also practice “sleep hygiene,”
              which includes{" "}

              </a>
              you can use to help yourself get more restful sleep, such as
              darkening your bedroom, avoiding screens two hours before going to
              bed, avoiding caffeinated beverages after noon, and avoiding
              eating up to three hours before bed. You can also use a meditation
              app, like Calm or Headspace, or do breathing exercises at bedtime
              to help create a sense of calm and relaxation before bed. Lastly,
              but most importantly, aim to get a good 8 hours of sleep every
              night and go to bed and rise at the same time each day.

              3. Establish a Daily Routine
            </h2>
            <p className="description">
              Just like you should develop a nighttime routine, you can try to
              avoid burnout by establishing a daily routine as well. Whether
              your routine is going to the gym before work or enjoying a family
              breakfast every morning, routine is good for keeping stress at
              bay. And the reason is simple. The human brain needs to{" "}

              unnecessary extra strain.

              4. Pencil Downtime Into Your Day
            </h2>
            <p className="description">
              Aim to have at least one evening a week to stop thinking about
              dentistry and do something else. This could be relaxing in front
              of the TV, reading a good book or going to the gym. Make sure you
              also get a break in the middle of the day to "switch off" and have
              a dedicated lunch break. You can even go for a short walk or
              meditate in a break room for a few minutes. We also recommend
              scheduling longer breaks or holidays in advance every few months.

              peaked at eight days compared to longer vacations. Even if you
              simply spend a few days off work at home, this time is invaluable
              to help you recharge. The quality of your days off may be more
              important than the quantity of the days you take off. You should
              also make time to spend with your family and non-dental friends,
              especially if you find yourself socializing with a lot of other

              5. Connect With Colleagues
            </h2>
            <p className="description">
              Dentistry can be a lonely profession. It can't be emphasized
              enough that you should build your professional network not only
              for clinical support, but also for personal support. Find a mentor
              or schedule regular one-to-one talks with others to discuss your
              practice. Just talking to someone can help you realize solutions
              that are right in front of your nose! There are many online
              communities and professional organizations you can also be part of
              or even local dental professional groups on social media.

              It’s always important to recognize where you and your team excel
              so you can celebrate your strengths and improve in areas of
              opportunity. Praise your staff individually for jobs well done,

              been lackluster. Excessive criticism, on the other hand, may
              impede work performance and accelerate burnout. While feedback is
              valuable in the workplace, making someone feel overwhelmed or
              overloaded with consistent negative feedback without instances of
              positive reinforcement may prevent them from improving and may
              even lead to burnout.

              shouldn’t work hard. However, it opens up possibilities for you to
              spend more time with family, friends, and hobbies you enjoy

              ordering, inventory management, patient communication—through an
              all-in-one platform, you can empower your team, seamlessly
              communicate with your healthcare community, and simplify your
              day-to-day operations to optimize patient care and grow your
              practice. Automated workflows create ease, balance, and
              harmony—delivering benefits beyond the business operations of the
              practice. By helping you save time, reduce costs, and minimize
              friction and frustration, a holistic, integrated healthcare
              business management platform enables you to focus on what matters
              most: patient care, practice growth, and personal wellbeing for
              both you and your staff.
